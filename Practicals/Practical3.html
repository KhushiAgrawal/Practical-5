    <h2><b>About Course</b></h2>
    <p>
      A full-stack developer understands the entire software stack, from the GUI
      front end to the database back end. However, not everyone agrees on the
      level of mastery needed to earn the title.A full-stack developer is a jack
      of all trades and a highly sought-after job candidate. The title implies a
      breadth of knowledge that can be invaluable to short-staffed startups and
      big companies managing complex apps alike.However, the term “full-stack
      developer” is controversial among developers. Some disparage the idea that
      anyone could be equally competent across an entire software stack, while
      others believe that the term has been so overused by employees and
      employers that it has become somewhat meaningless.
